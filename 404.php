	<h2>Page Not Found</h2>
	<p class='p1'>This is the worst thing that has ever happened in the history of humanity. Absolute worst. No event, since the beginning of time, has ever been as much of a travesty as this one. Furthermore, it is demonstrably the most horrible event that is physically capable of occurring. This, my friends, is the outright, indisputable nadir of not only civilization, but also of the observable universe itself.</p>

	<p class='p2'>Fortunately, now that this has happened, we can all take comfort in the fact that it only goes uphill from here. Now that the great 404ing of <?php echo(setting('sitename'))?> has passed us by, we can look forward to a brighter future. We may still have hardships and setbacks, we may still sustain wounds and shed tears, but throughout it all, we shall retain in our hearts and minds that at least it's not as bad as that one time we got a 404 error on some website.</p>
